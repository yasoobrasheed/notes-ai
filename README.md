This is a side project to learn more about LLMs and RAG.

1. Launch a foundational LLM in a container and practice playing around with it from your local machine
2. Build Bear note parser to fetch note metadata and convert tags to valuable pieces of information
3. Store all your text files in a vector database hosted in a container
4. Run a RAG over this data teach the LLM via prompt generation to understand what your notes mean.
5. Set up a clean interface for you to query your LLM with the text file data in your DB
6. Figure out how to create diffs between bear backups and store all your notes in S3. These diffs will become new data to query your LLM for.
7. Then make it more complicated by trying out different LLMs and learning new methods of tuning and prompting
